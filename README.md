# XOR-Encryption-GUI
To demonstrate the power of the XOR logic gate I created a few functions in Python that converts an ASCII string and a shift key(integer), converts them to binary and runs the XOR gate on them to produce a XOR encrypted string
This is all done via a neat GUI created using Python's tkinter module.
